			<h3>2] Vehicle detection</h3>	
		
			<p>Traffic Analysis has been a problem that city planners have dealt with for years. Smarter ways are being developed to analyze traffic and streamline the process. Analysis of traffic may account for the number of vehicles in an area per some arbitrary time period and the class of vehicles. </p>

			<p>People have designed such mechanisms for decades now but most of them involve use of sensors to detect the vehicles i.e. a couple of proximity sensors to calculate the direction of the moving vehicle. The system involves capturing frames from the video to perform background subtraction in order to detect the vehicle.</p>
